# UX Design
The site is a fun but challenging quiz.
## Audience
It is target audience is assumed to have a good level of general knowledge or have studied geography as part of their academics.

## Site Design and User Stories
The site's design is informed by the *users stories* and aims to provide:
- An elegant yet simple and intuitive inteface
- A place to input a name to tailor their unique results
- Be able to discern what question they are on
- Have visual cue as to how much time is left to answer the current question
- Use a simple mouse click to select the answer to each question
- Provide the option to change their mind before moving to the next question
- Get feedback *during* the quiz on how they answered the previous questions
- At the end of the quiz to get a bespoke message on how they performed
- Have the option to play again
- Have a means of viewing the developer's other work and contacting them via LinkedIn

## Wireframing
[Wireframes](docs/wireframes) were created using Balsamiq desktop.
![Desktop Landing](docs/wireframes/desktop-landing-section.png "Landing section on desktop")
![Tablet Landing](docs/wireframes/tablet-landing-section.png "Landing section on tablet")
![Mobile Landing](docs/wireframes/mobile-landing-section.png "Landing section on mobile")
![Desktop Quiz](docs/wireframes/desktop-quiz-section.png "Quiz section on desktop")
![Tablet Quiz](docs/wireframes/tablet-quiz-section.png "Quiz section on tablet")
![Mobile Quiz](docs/wireframes/mobile-quiz-section.png "Quiz section on mobile")
![Results](docs/wireframes/results-section.png "Results section")

As the project developed other features were added to realise functionality. These included: 
- A call to action button to begin the quiz
- A name input section before the first question
- A replay button in the results section to easily navigate to the beginning of the page

## Color Scheme and Accessibility

The *color scheme* was derived from a piece of fabric passed through [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image-gradient)
![color_scheme](docs/readme/adobe-color-image.png "Color Scheme")

To meet WCAG 2.0 criteria, the generated color scheme was then passed to [eightshapes.com](http://www.eightshapes.com) to generate an [*accessibility table*](docs/readme/color-contrast-grid.png "Color Accessibilty Table").

![color_scheme](docs/readme/color-contrast-grid.png "Accessibility Table")


## Code Reusability and Site Layout
Extensive use was made off flexbox to position elements and were possible classes within the html were used to inject most of the CSS styles into the page.
This reduced the size and complexity of the CSS used.

```html
<section id="quiz" class="flex-column flex-center rounded-border max-width">
</section>
```

```css
.rounded-border {
border-radius: 10px;
}
```

# Existing Features

## One Page Site and Future Implementations
For ease, the site is limited to one page as this is my first time using Javascript (JS) within the DOM.  Given current limitations, I was still able to activate the page by showing/hiding different sections by adding event listeners to specific elements.
This gives the appearance of the site being more complex than it actually is.

```js
function startNewGame() {
  landingSection.style.display = "none";
  newGameSection.style.display = "inline-flex";
  playerName.focus();
}

playQuizButton.addEventListener("click", startNewGame);
```

Further development implementations could be: 
- A leaderboard
- An option for the user to change the site color scheme. JS can easily do this by adding/removing classes on targeted elements.
- A facility to print a certificate

## Header and Background
![desktop](docs/readme/header.png "Header")

The site follows a simple one page design therefore an anchor tag isn't required on the [header](docs/readme/header.png "Header section").

Also, no menus are needed as navigation is achieved using JS.

An alpha value of 0.85 is used to help blend the heading into the [*background*](docs/readme/background.png "Background Image") image attached to the body.  An old fashioned globe implicitly tells the user the site is geography based.

Note the use of Latin and two contrasting font styles, one modern and the other cursive.  This is to convey that Geography is a modern science grounded in knowledge built up over millennia.

## Footer
![footer](docs/readme/footer.png "Footer section")

The [*footer's*](docs/readme/footer.png "Footer section") purpose is to provide access to the developers Github repos and LinkedIn profile via the favicon links.  These open in new tabs.
Their goal is to allow potential employers and other students to review or use the code to assist in their own projects. 

## Landing Section
This section is a launch point for the user and is minimalist by design.  The call to action button acts as a signpost to begin the quiz.

![Call To Action Button](docs/readme/landing-page-call-to-action.png "Call to Action Button")

## Name Section
The name section has a few useful features:
- Autofocus on the name input element to save the user having to manually select.  This is expecially useful on mobile devices. The blinking cursor shows the application
is ready for input.
- Two buttons to either start or leave quiz and return to landing section. This gives the user added control before beginning the game.
- An additional event listener on the input element for pressing enter on a keyboard or Go on a mobile device keypad.  This has the same result as clicking the start button.
- An error handler that applies a red border to the input box in the event where no player name is provided.

![Name Section](docs/readme/input-name-section.png "Name Section")

## Quiz Section

### Quiz Info Bar
![Quiz Info Bar](docs/readme/quiz-info.png "Quiz Info Bar")

Features include:
- An indicator stating the current question number out of a total of the total quiz length.. 
- A countdown timer with intuitive favicon showing a person and clockface
- A countdown bar for the more visual user

### Questions and Answers
![Question Answer Next](docs/readme/question-answer-next.png "Question Answer Next")

Features include:
- One question and four multiple choice answers
- On selected answer has a different format
- The user can change their mind and select a different answer before clicking next button to move to next question

### Score Tracker
![Score Tracker](docs/readme/quiz-answer-feedback.png "Score Tracker")

As the quiz defaults to 10 questions, 10 elements were hard coded into the html.  The purpose of these are to give a visual cue to the user on how well they are doing.

NB. a future implementation could be to change the number of quiz  questions.  It would be possible to change the score tracker element to reflect the total question count set by the ``quizLength`` variable in the JS file by means of a template literal.

Elements are color coded and mean the following:
- *Yellow* shows the question the user is currently on.  This supplements the question number display in the quiz info bar above the question
- *Gray* shows the user didn't confirm an answer for the previous question before the 30 second countdown reached zero.
- *Red* shows a wrong answer
- *Green* shows a correct answer

On testing this feature with family and work colleagues I found this type of feedback improved user experience as they shared their progress with the group.

## Results Section
![Results Section](docs/readme/results.png "Results Section")

The results modal provides the user with:
- Their total score out of 10
- A bespoke message comprised of the name they proved before the 1st question with text feedback based on their score. 
- A REPLAY button

# Testing
## Fixed Bugs
- Shuffle functionality added to quiz before beginning using Fisher/Yates method.  This way we can always ask the same number of questions but 
improve their variation in the case the user plays more than once.
- User could proceed to quiz without entering text into playerName input
- Score Tracker displayed correct/incorrect answer before user moved onto next question.  This gave the oppurtunity to cheat.
- Syncing the countdown bar with the countdown timer element.

## Unfixed Bugs
If the user doesn't select an answer withing 30 seconds the score tracker for the current question should default to a gray color.

It was found if a question was answered correctly / incorrectly and any subsequent question wasn't answered within 30 seconds, the last answered questions
color of red or green was assumed.  This scenario is highly unlikely to be seen by the user as they are assumed to make an effort to answer a question and 
move on, even if they are unsure of the answer.

# Credits
Once more a special mention is reserved for my mentor [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN).  Through him I'm learning that being a developer is about more than
learning code.  It is about having a calm, methodical approach and realising there is a solution to every problem.  It just takes research and perseverance.

Also I'd like to thank my fellow students and alumni at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) for sharing their insights and approaches via Slack.

Special credit goes to [Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/quiz/50-capital-cities-at-random-quiz) which helped me formulate an approach to my own project.

Questions are based of my own general knowledge from years pouring over [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Code+Institute/@53.2996313,-6.1656661,11.75z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x48670e99733f3617:0x7ff7202fe3dea603!8m2!3d53.2981987!4d-6.178654) and watching too many videos on [Youtube](youtube.com) and [Curiosity Stream](https://curiositystream.com)!
